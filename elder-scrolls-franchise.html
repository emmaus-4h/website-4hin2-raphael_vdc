			<h1>The Elder Scrolls: Arena</h1>
			<hr/>
				<h3>Introduction to the Game</h3>
				<p>
					The Elder Scrolls: Arena is an open-world action role-playing video game developed and published by Bethesda Softworks. The
					first game in the Elder Scrolls series, it was released for MS-DOS on March 25, 1994. Like its sequels, Arena takes
					place on the continent of Tamriel, complete with wilderness, dungeons, and a spell creation system that allows players
					to mix various spell effects. In 2004, a downloadable version of the game was made available free of charge as part
					of the tenth anniversary of the series.
				</p>

				<h3>Plot</h3>
				<p>
					The game's setting begins in Tamriel on the 389th year of the Third Era, when Emperor Uriel Septim VII summons his advisor
					and Imperial Battlemage Jagar Tharn over concerns of betrayal from within the court. It transpires that his concerns
					were justified when Tharn is revealed to be the traitor, magically trapping the Emperor and his general, Talin Warhaft,
					in another dimension. When Tharn proceeds to magically disguise himself as Emperor in order to usurp the throne, his
					conspiracy is witnessed by mage apprentice Ria Silmane, whom he murders before she can warn the Elder Council. Tharn
					then summons demon minions to replace the Emperor's Guard and in his disguise he sends the player character, a court
					official and subordinate of General Warhaft, to die in the Imperial dungeons. Following her death, Ria uses her magic
					to take an incorporeal form, holding herself together long enough to inform the imprisoned player of Tharn's betrayal
					and instructs them throughout their escape from the infamous dungeons. Past that point, she lacks the power to manifest
					physically and appears to the player during dreams. She creates a key to allow the player to escape the dungeons and
					teleports them to a different province through a mystical Shift Gate. The player is informed that the only way to stop
					Tharn is to get hold of the Staff of Chaos which holds his lifeforce. This staff has been split by Tharn into many fragments
					throughout the continent of Tamriel. Each time one is found, Ria appears to the player the next time they rest, in order
					to provide the general location of the next fragment. At the end of the quest in 3E 399 (a decade after the start of
					the game), the player finds the final piece and reassembles the staff. This, however, does not release the Emperor as
					all of the staff's power has been drained into the Jewel of Fire, an oversight by Ria. The player travels to the Imperial
					City to confront Tharn's minions, the player finds the Jewel of Fire and touches it with the Staff of Chaos, this destroys
					both the jewel and the staff as well as releasing the Emperor. The jewel also turned out to be where Tharn has stored
					his lifeforce and the destruction of the jewel resulted in his death. As a token of respect and gratitude, Uriel Septim
					grants the player the title of Eternal Champion, and Ria Silmane finally enters the afterlife.
				</p>

				<h3>Introduction to the Main Quest</h3>
				<p>
					Talin awoke in the darkened cell, his head pounding from the blow it had received. A single candle guttered and flamed in
					one corner. Occasionally the clink of chains could be heard as they swung in a slight, fetid breeze. He knew where he
					was now. It came back to him even as he struggled to his feet. Fighting off the nausea he made his way to a crude stone
					bench. I have been taken by the Emperor, but for what? His thoughts were interrupted by a low moan that came drifting
					down the corridor outside his cell door. Suddenly he was glad for the obvious strength of his cell door. I have been
					left to die, he thought incredulously. They did not even bother to strip me of my possessions. Indeed, upon self-examination
					Talin found that he still carried his dagger and his pouch of money. It seemed that the Emperor had no fears of his
					escape. And why should he? He did a quick circumspection of the room, finding that except for the slime covered walls
					and floor, no water or food had been left. A slow death indeed. Suddenly the air near the center of the cell seemed
					to brighten, slowly coalescing into a globe of brilliance. Talin fell back, shielding his eyes from the glare. The light
					receded, and in the purple afterimages of that burst he could see the shimmering form of a woman floating, her body
					draped in gossamer and blown by an unseen wind.

			<h1>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</h1>
			<hr/>
				<h3>Introduction to the Game</h3>
				<p>
					The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall is the second installment in The Elder Scrolls series. It is set in the Iliac Bay area of
					High Rock and Hammerfell during the Third Era of Tamriel's history, ending in an event called the Warp in the West.
					The plot of the game revolves around the Mantella and Totem of Tiber Septim, which together can activate the Numidium.
				</p>

				<h3>Plot</h3>
				<p>
					Daggerfall is set in the Iliac Bay, between the provinces of High Rock and Hammerfell. The player is sent here at the personal
					request of the Emperor. He wants the player to do two things: First, the player must free the ghost of King Lysandus
					from his earthly shackles; Second, the player must discover what happened to a letter from the Emperor to the former
					queen of Daggerfall. The letter reveals that Lysandus's mother, Nulfaga, knows the location of the Mantella, the key
					to resurrecting the first Numidium, a powerful brass golem. The emperor wants his spy to force Nulfaga into revealing
					the location of the Mantella so that the Blades can finish the reconstruction of the Numidium. Through a series of mishaps
					and confusions the letter fell into the hands of an orc by the name of Gortworg. Not knowing what the Mantella is, Gortworg
					consults Mannimarco, the King of Worms (the leader of the Necromancers). During this time the Underking, who originally
					destroyed the first Numidium because of its misuse by Tiber Septim, is recuperating deep within a tomb of High Rock
					after expending so much energy destroying it the first time. In order for the player to give the Mantella to anyone,
					the player must kill King Lysandus's murderer and put his ghost to rest. After accomplishing this, the player must steal
					the totem of Tiber Septim from King Gothryd of Daggerfall, and free the Mantella from its prison in Aetherius. Following
					this the player has six choices of how to deal with the Mantella. Daggerfall has several endings: If the player gives
					the Mantella to the Underking, he absorbs its power, passes into eternal rest, and creates a large "magicka free" area
					around himself. If Gortworg is victorious, he uses the Numidium to destroy the Imperial forces and the "Bay Kings",
					the rulers of the several provinces of the Iliac Bay. The Underking arrives shortly thereafter to destroy the first
					Numidium once and for all, losing his own life in the process. Gortworg then succeeds in creating Orsinium, a kingdom
					of Orcs. If the Blades are victorious, they succeed in recreating the first Numidium and use it to defeat the Bay Kings
					and the Orcs as well as unite all the provinces of Tamriel under the empire once again. If any of the Bay Kings win,
					that king will use the first Numidium to defeat all the other kings just before the Underking destroys him and itself.
					If Mannimarco receives the Mantella, he uses it to make himself a god. One more ending, as described in the strategy
					guide The Daggerfall Chronicles and elsewhere, was planned by Bethesda, but is not achievable in-game: if the player
					activates the Mantella while in possession of the totem (the controlling device of the Numidium), the Numidium will
					slay the player, go out of control, and be destroyed by Imperial forces.
				</p>

				<h3>Introduction to the Main Quest</h3>
				<p>
					Daggerfall is a city in the Breton homeland of High Rock. The player is sent here at the personal request of the Emperor.
					He wants the player to do two things. Firstly, the player must free the ghost of the late King Lysandus from his earthly
					shackles. Secondly, the player must retrieve a letter from the Emperor to a Blades spy in the court of Daggerfall. The
					letter reveals that Lysandus' mother, Nulfaga, knows the location of the Mantella, the key to resurrecting the first
					Numidium. The Emperor wants his spy to force Nulfaga into revealing the location of the Mantella so that the Blades
					can finish the reconstruction of the Numidium. Through a series of mishaps and confusions, the letter fell into the
					hands of an orc by the name of Gortworg. Gortworg, not knowing what the Mantella is, consults Mannimarco, the King of
					Worms (the leader of the Necromancers). During this time, the Underking, who originally destroyed the first Numidium
					because of its misuse by Tiber Septim, is recuperating deep within a tomb of High Rock, after expending so much energy
					destroying it the first time. In order for the player to give the Mantella to anyone, the player must kill king Lysandus'
					murderer and put his ghost to rest. After accomplishing this, the power of the Mantella restores the Underking's power.

			<h1>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</h1>
			<hr/>
				<h3>Introduction to the Game</h3>
				<p>
					The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is the third chapter in The Elder Scrolls series of role-playing games (RPG) developed and
					published by Bethesda Softworks. It is set in and around the province of Morrowind, in particular the island of Vvardenfell.
					It has two expansion packs, Tribunal (2002) and Bloodmoon (2003). The game was released for PC on May 1, 2002, in North
					America and May 2, 2002, in Europe. The Xbox version was released on June 6, 2002, in North America and November 22
					in Europe. It is available for the PC and Xbox. It is backward compatible on the Xbox 360 and Xbox One.
				</p>

				<h3>Plot</h3>
				<p>
					While Morrowind contains many quests and storylines, the central plot revolves around The Tribunal, a triumvirate of god-like
					beings ruling over Morrowind, and their struggle against a former ally, the deity Dagoth Ur and his Sixth House – a
					cult of followers stretching out from Red Mountain, the volcanic center of Vvardenfell, the island on which the game
					is set. Dagoth Ur has used the Heart of Lorkhan, an artifact of great power, to make himself immortal and now seeks
					to drive the Imperial Legion occupiers from Morrowind using his network of spies, as well as Akulakhan, an enormous
					mechanical golem powered by the Heart of Lorkhan. After a storm and a strange dream vision, the player character (PC)
					begins in a town called Seyda Neen, fresh off a boat from a mainland prison, freed by the string-pulling of the current
					ruler of the Tamrielic Empire, Emperor Uriel Septim VII. The PC is given the task of meeting Caius Cosades, a member
					of the Blades, a secret group of spies and agents working for the Emperor and the Empire. Cosades inducts the player
					into the Blades on the Emperor's orders and sets the player on various quests to uncover the mysterious disappearances
					and revelations that the citizens of Vvardenfell have experienced, particularly the Sixth House and the Ashlander prophecies
					of the Nerevarine. It is later revealed that the induction under Cosades, and the player's release from prison, was
					due to the Emperor's suspicion that the player might be the Nerevarine – a reincarnation of the legendary Dunmer hero
					Indoril Nerevar – or at least someone who would make a convincing imposter to use for political gain. The PC is tasked
					with uncovering the prophecies regarding the Nerevarine and to fulfill them to finally defeat Dagoth Ur and his Sixth
					House cult. Prophecies from the nomadic Dunmer people living in the Ashlands, the Ashlanders, predict that Nerevar's
					incarnate will fulfill a set of seven prophecies. The first two prophecies are that the Nerevarine will be born on a
					certain day to uncertain parents, and will be immune to Corprus disease, a Divine disease created by Dagoth Ur. The
					player has already fulfilled the first, and hence was chosen for the task. The player becomes immune to Corprus by contracting
					the disease and surviving an experimental cure. Fulfilling these, the player seeks to complete the third prophecy, a
					test to find the Moon-and-Star (also called One-Clan-Under-Moon-And-Star), the symbolic ring originally worn by Nerevar,
					which has the power to instantly kill anyone, apart from himself (and by extension, the Nerevarine), who tries to wear
					it. Upon finding and equipping the ring, the player receives a vision from Azura, the ancient Daedric Prince of the
					Dawn and Dusk, who confirms that the player is Nerevar's incarnate. The Nerevarine completes the fourth and fifth trials,
					which are to rally the Great Houses of the Dunmer and Ashlanders of Vvardenfell under one banner. After receiving the
					support and being declared "Hortator" by every Great House and "Nerevarine" by all nomadic Ashlander tribes, the player
					is officially, albeit reluctantly, called "Nerevarine" by the Tribunal Temple, who normally persecute anyone who claims
					to be the Nerevarine and sentences them to death. The Nerevarine is invited to the palace of the poet god-king Vivec,
					one of the three deities that form the basis of Morrowind's religion, known as the Tribunal, to discuss the assault
					on Dagoth Ur's stronghold in the heart of Red Mountain. Vivec presents the player with the gauntlet 'Wraithguard', an
					ancient Dwemer artifact that allows the use of the tools Sunder and Keening. These ancient weapons were created by the
					Dwemer to tap into the power of the fabled Heart of Lorkhan, which they found beneath Red Mountain - and these same
					tools have been used by the Tribunal and Dagoth Ur to reach their god-like status. The tools can, however, also destroy
					the fabled Heart of Lorkhan, but without having the Wraithguard equipped, they will deal a fatal blow to whoever wields
					them. The player travels into Red Mountain to Dagoth Ur's citadel. After talking with Dagoth Ur, who attempts to sway
					the player to his side with the claim that he is merely following Nerevar's final orders, the player and Dagoth Ur fight.
					Besting Dagoth Ur, the Nerevarine soon discovers that while the Heart of Lorkhan is still intact, Dagoth Ur remains
					immortal and he soon returns from death. Making his way to the very heart of the mountain, the Nerevarine finds the
					Heart of Lorkhan and destroys it, severing Dagoth Ur from his power and ultimately killing him. Akulakhan's Chamber,
					where Lorkhan's heart resided, is destroyed in the process as the cavern collapses, and in turn, Red Mountain is cleared
					of blight and The Sixth House falls. Upon escaping from the chamber, the Nerevarine is congratulated by Azura, who comes
					to reward the player's efforts of fulfilling the prophecy.
				</p>

				<h3>Introduction to the Main Quest</h3>
				<p>
					In the opening cinematic scene Azura explains to the dreaming Nerevarine that they have been taken from the Imperial City's
					prison to Morrowind. Azura gives only a reassurance, with no explanation as to why you have been chosen or even for
					what exactly you've been chosen. As this scene is playing out there are runes scrolling faintly in the background and
					as Azura finishes speaking one line becomes readable."Many fall, but one remains." The next voice heard is that of a
					concerned Dunmer prisoner named Jiub who wakes you from the dream and asks for your name. This is where the character
					creation begins and the game opens up. Once freed, the game world becomes an incredibly interactive environment filled
					with opportunities for fun and adventure. Even though the main quest centers on the player being the Nerevarine of prophecy,
					it is an open-play style role-playing game, meaning you can do what you want and be who you wish. Prowl the streets
					as a nimble thief picking pockets and fencing ill-gotten treasure, join the Mages Guild and rise to the rank of Arch-Mage,
					be an assassin stalking targets in the shadows, become a noble member of one of the Great Houses, and even explore "life"
					as a vampire or a werewolf.
				</p>

				<h3>Expansions (DLC)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Tribunal</li>
					<p>
						The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal is the first expansion for Bethesda Softwork's The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, and is included
						in the Game of the Year edition, along with Bloodmoon. It takes place in the temple/city of Mournhold, the capital
						of Morrowind, located in the larger city of Almalexia. The title refers to the three "Living Gods," known as the Tribunal.
					</p>
					<li>Bloodmoon</li>
					<p>
						Unlike the first expansion Tribunal, which added a city separate from the world map consisting of interior cells, Bloodmoon
						adds a large new island to the original world map, a cold northern territory named Solstheim. Rather than the Dunmer
						(dark elves) that are the indigenous race in nearby Morrowind, Solstheim is populated largely by the Nords. This is
						largely due to the fact that the island sits more or less astride the border between Morrowind and the Nord homeland
						of Skyrim. This expansion adds new enemies, the East Empire Company as a joinable faction, and the possibility to become
						a werewolf, akin to the inclusion of vampires seen in Morrowind. Bloodmoon also uses larger and more detailed environments,
						including snowfall, thus raising the computer hardware requirements, though the ash storms of the original game are
						much harder on computers than the snow of Bloodmoon.

			<h1>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</h1>
			<hr/>
				<h3>Introduction to the Game</h3>
				<p>
					The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is a single-player role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published
					by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fourth installment of The Elder Scrolls series and is set in the province of Cyrodiil,
					the heart of the Septim Empire, during the Oblivion Crisis.
				</p>

				<h3>Personal Experience</h3>
				<p>
					From personal experience, Oblivion was a great game. Though old(2006) it was still relevant and with some graphic overhaul
					mods it looks like it came out at the same time with skyrim. I liked the game, played around 50 hours of it and completed
					the main questline together with the majority of major side-quests. Alltogether a nice game with a good plot, very fitting
					for the Elder Scrolls franchise.
				</p>

				<h3>Plot</h3>
				<p>
					Oblivion is set during the Third Era, six years after the events of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, although it is not
					a direct sequel to it or any other game.[19] The game is set in Cyrodiil—a province of Tamriel, the continent on which
					all the games in the series have so far taken place. The story begins with the player imprisoned in a cell for an unknown
					crime. Emperor Uriel Septim VII, accompanied by Imperial bodyguards known as the Blades, arrives in the prison, fleeing
					from assassins who have murdered the emperor's three sons and are now targeting him. The emperor and the Blades reveal
					that the player's jail cell contains a secret entrance to a part of the city's sewer that functions as an escape route.
					Pardoned by the emperor, the player follows the group into the sewer, where they come under attack by assassins. The
					blade captain is cut down during the fighting that ensues. Knowing he is destined to die by the hands of the assassins,
					Uriel Septim entrusts the player with the Amulet of Kings, worn by the Septim emperors of Tamriel, and orders the player
					to take it to a man named Jauffre, the grandmaster of the Blades, at Weynon Priory. Immediately afterward, one of the
					assassins kills the emperor. The player escapes the sewer and heads out into the open world of Cyrodiil. The lack of
					an heir for Uriel Septim has broken an old covenant—the barrier to Oblivion: a dangerous realm that is in another dimension.
					Multiple gates to Oblivion open, and an invasion of Tamriel begins by magical creatures known as Daedra, killing and
					destroying anything in their path. Jauffre tells the player that the only way to close the gates permanently is to find
					someone of the royal bloodline to retake the throne and relight the Dragonfires—with the Amulet of Kings—in the Imperial
					City. However, there is an illegitimate son named Martin, who is a priest in the city of Kvatch. Upon arriving at Kvatch,
					the player finds that the Daedra have destroyed the city and very few survivors remain. A massive Oblivion Gate is obstructing
					the main city entrance, and the player must venture through the gate into the Deadlands—one of the planes of Oblivion—in
					order to close it from the inside and allow access to the city. After closing the gate, the player enters Kvatch and
					takes it back from the Daedra with the assistance of surviving guardsmen. Martin has survived, and the player persuades
					him to come to Weynon Priory. The player, now recognized as the Hero of Kvatch, returns to Weynon Priory with Martin,
					finding that it has come under attack by assassins and that the Amulet of Kings has been stolen. The player escorts
					Jauffre and Martin to Cloud Ruler Temple, the stronghold of the Blades. There, Martin is recognized as the emperor and
					is given command of the Blades. The player is optionally entered into their ranks and sets off in search of the amulet.
					After gathering information, the player learns that the group responsible for Uriel Septim's assassination and the theft
					of the amulet are the Mythic Dawn, a cult dedicated to the worshiping of Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Prince of Destruction.
					The cult believes Dagon is the true creator of the world and wish for him to "cleanse" it of all impurities. Killing
					the emperor and thus removing the barriers to Oblivion was the first step in realizing this idea. The player attempts
					to infiltrate the secret meeting place of the cult in the hopes of retrieving the amulet. When the player does so, the
					cult's leader, Mankar Camoran, escapes through a portal, taking the amulet with him. The player takes the book that
					had opened the portal to Martin, who deduces a way to reopen the portal. The player seeks out three key artifacts necessary
					to recreate the portal: a Daedric artifact, The Blood of the Divines (in this case, the armor of the first Septim emperor
					serves as a substitute), and a Great Welkynd Stone. With all three retrieved, Martin reveals that a final ingredient
					is needed: a Great Sigil Stone from inside a Great Gate similar to the one that devastated Kvatch. Martin and Jauffre
					decide to allow the city of Bruma to be attacked by Daedra so that a Great Gate will be opened. Once it is, the player
					obtains the Stone and closes the Gate, also saving Bruma. A portal is created at Cloud Ruler Temple, and the player
					is sent through to Mankar Camoran's created realm of Paradise. After bypassing Daedra, Mythic Dawn members and obstacles,
					the player confronts Camoran and kills him. The player returns the Amulet of Kings to Martin, and they subsequently
					travel to the Imperial City with the Blades to relight the Dragonfires and end the Daedric invasion. They find the city
					under attack by Daedra and an enormous avatar of Mehrunes Dagon himself. The player and Martin fight their way to the
					Temple of the One. There, Martin laments that they are powerless against Dagon's avatar and explains that they can only
					defeat him one way. He bids farewell to the player and shatters the Amulet of Kings, merging himself with the spirit
					of Akatosh, the Dragon-God of Time, thus becoming Akatosh's avatar. After a battle, Akatosh casts Dagon back into Oblivion
					and lets out a mighty roar before turning to stone. Martin, whose soul was consumed by the amulet, enters the afterlife
					to join his forebears. In a telepathic monologue to the player, he sheds an optimistic light, explaining that while
					the Amulet of Kings is destroyed and the throne again lies empty, the gates of Oblivion are now shut forever, and the
					future of Tamriel now lies in the player's hands. The Empire's high chancellor sincerely thanks the player for their
					service during the crisis and proclaims them as the seventh Champion of Cyrodiil.
				</p>
				<h3>Introduction to the Main Quest</h3>
				<p>
					The plot begins six years after the events of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind in 3E 433. Emperor Uriel Septim VII is assassinated
					as he attempts to flee from the Imperial City after learning that assassins have killed his sons. However, before his
					death, he hands the Amulet of Kings over to the person who would become the Hero of Kvatch, a lowly prisoner which Uriel
					had seen in his dreams, with instructions to "close shut the jaws of Oblivion." The adventure begins after a prison
					escape and with a quest to find a man named Jauffre - and eventually the illegitimate son of Uriel, the last surviving
					heir to the Septim throne, hidden away for protection since his birth. Ultimately, the Hero must stop the invasion from
					Oblivion and stand between the future of Tamriel and the Daedric Prince of Destruction himself.

			<h1>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h1>
			<hr/>
				<h3>Introduction to the Game</h3>
				<p>
					The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a single-player role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by
					Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls action/adventure RPG fantasy video game series,
					and follows The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion by approximately 200 years, during the Fourth Era. The game was announced
					on November 11, 2010 at the Spike Video Game Awards in Los Angeles, with a release date of November 11, 2011. It features
					Radiant A.I., along with Radiant Storytelling or Radiant Story, to help enhance quests, and a new and improved graphics
					engine.[1][2]
				</p>
				<h3>Personal Experience</h3>
				<p>
					I have played about 300 hours of skyrim and honestly, it's a very good game especially for it's time and even now it's among
					the best games. Especially the modding community is absolutely amazing. I have played with around 300 mods before which
					is a normal amount of mods for certain people. Majority of those mods were texture overhauls, some other were remakes
					for specific characters like the mod 'Serana Diologue Add-on' which adds thousands of new voicelines to Serana, an essential
					npc in the Dawnguard DLC questline. But overall the game is incredible and if you like RPG's and open world games this
					one is definitely a must.
				</p>
				<h3>Plot</h3>
				<p>
					Prior to the beginning of the game, Imperial soldiers catch the Dragonborn illegally crossing the border into Skyrim and
					mistake them for a Stormcloak rebel, a crime for which the player receives a death sentence. The execution of the player
					character by the Imperials in Helgen, a small settlement in Skyrim's south, is interrupted when Alduin starts laying
					waste to the village. The player manages to escape through the tunnels underneath the keep, and heads to the nearby
					village of Riverwood, whose inhabitants ask the player to inform the Jarl of Whiterun, a large town to the north, of
					the dragon attack. After meeting with Jarl Balgruuf, and retrieving a tablet with information about the dragons from
					a nearby barrow on his behalf, the player kills a dragon which attacks nearby and absorbs its soul. After "shouting",
					the player is informed that they must be Dragonborn, and is soon summoned by the Greybeard monks. After a long journey
					and climb up the Throat of the World, the tallest mountain in Tamriel and home of the Greybeards, the Dragonborn is
					informed by Arngeir of their heritage and role in stopping Alduin, and begins their training. The Dragonborn is intercepted
					on one training quest by Delphine, a member of the order of the Blades, who in ancient times had served the Dragonborn.
					Delphine arranges for the Dragonborn to infiltrate the Thalmor Embassy to gain information; they learn that another
					member of the Blades, named Esbern, is in hiding in Riften. When Delphine and the Dragonborn find him, he reveals that
					the ancient Blades had carved a massive engraving in a temple in the Reach, an unstable region in Skyrim's west. This
					carving, called Alduin's Wall, depicted the dragon's defeat at the hands of the ancient Nords, and Esbern deciphers
					that those warriors had used a special shout to remove his ability to fly. The Dragonborn questions Arngeir, who reveals
					that the shout goes against the creeds of the Greybeards. He directs the Dragonborn to Paarthurnax, who lives on the
					summit of the Throat, to better conceal his existence. Paarthurnax reveals that although neither he nor anyone else
					knows the shout, Alduin's defeat through the power of an Elder Scroll had left a gash in time, and theorizes that reading
					a Scroll would allow the Dragonborn to look through time and learn the shout from those who created it. Having delved
					into a massive Dwemer city called Blackreach, far below the ground, the Dragonborn retrieves the Scroll and reads it
					on the Throat, the site of the ancient battle. Alduin arrives and fights with Paarthurnax and the Dragonborn, who has
					learned the shout and overpowers Alduin, who flees. The Dragonborn learns from Esbern how to summon a dragon named Odahviing,
					whom they trap in Whiterun with Jarl Balgruuf's assistance. Odahviing, believing that the Dragonborn is mightier than
					Alduin, turns on his former leader and reveals that he has gone to recover his strength in Sovngarde, the Nordic afterlife,
					where he feeds on the souls of the dead. Since the portal to Sovngarde cannot be reached on foot, Odahviing bargains
					his freedom in exchange for flying the Dragonborn there. Entering Sovngarde, the Dragonborn meets the three heroes who
					had defeated Alduin originally; with their help, the Dragonborn kills Alduin.

						he Elder Scrolls V: Dawnguard is the first official add-on for the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls series, Skyrim.
						Released first for the Xbox 360 on 26 June 2012, and later on 2 August for PC, Dawnguard revolves around an ancient
						prophecy predicted by an Elder Scroll. Foretelling the eternal obfuscation of the sun, the scroll gave instructions
						on how to perform a magic ritual with a mythic bow and a special blood sacrifice. A legion of vampires known as the
						Volkihar Clan, lead by Lord Harkon, seek to actuate the prophecy by performing the ritual; the Dawnguard, a faction
						of crossbow-wielding vampire hunters counters their aims. Skyrim's Dragonborn protagonist chooses whether to join the
						Dawnguard and prevent Nirn from being plunged in irrevocable night, or assist the vampire coven with realizing their
						malevolent ambition.

						The Elder Scrolls V: Hearthfire is the second official add-on for the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls series, Skyrim.
						Released for the Xbox 360 on September 4th, 2012. Hearthfire focuses around purchasing land and designing, building
						and maintaining a homestead. The option to hire stewards, carriage drivers and a personal bard are also available.
						With five pre-built purchasable houses already present in Skyrim, it's now possible to own property in every hold,
						except Winterhold. In addition, an adoption mechanic has been introduced that allows the Dragonborn to adopt children
						and raise them in the newly built home, provided there is room for them. Previously bought homes can be altered to
						have a children's bedroom fitted into them.

						The Elder Scrolls V: Dragonborn is the third and final official add-on for the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls series,
						Skyrim. The plot involves traveling to the island of Solstheim and the return of a mysterious former dragon priest
						called Miraak, one-time ruler of the island. Unlike the ancient dragon priests of Skyrim, Miraak was Dragonborn, supposedly
						the first person to be gifted with the dragon blood, and he possesses the ability to absorb dragon souls, much like
						the Last Dragonborn. The main quest-line also features traveling to Apocrypha, realm of Hermaeus Mora, Daedric Prince
						of forbidden knowledge. Here the Dragonborn must recover the mysterious Black Books in order to learn new powers and
						stop Miraak. In addition, the add-on features a plethora of new quests, characters, dragon shouts, armor, weaponry
						and the ability to tame and ride dragons.
