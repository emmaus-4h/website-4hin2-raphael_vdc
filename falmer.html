      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Commonly referred to as the Falmer language, this is a language originally written by the Snow Elves. The term "Falmer" is used due to the fact that it is the original name of the Snow Elves. The language has an apparant similarity to Ayleidoon, the language of the Ayleids.
      </p>

			<h3>History</h3>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				The Falmer Alphabet is, or rather was, the alphabet used by the Snow Elves. It is a very stylized script, quite the opposite of the minimalist script of their Dwemer captors. There are only two known examples of the language, both appearing in Skyrim. The very low number of examples is probably due to the fact that the many Snow Elves who sought asylum with the Dwemer were forced to lose their sight, at which point they ceased to require a written language.
				Gallus's Encoded Journal, written by a former Guild Master of the Thieves Guild, is written in the Falmer alphabet, but it directly transliterates into English. The Skyrim add-on Dawnguard adds an additional four books, Unknown Book, Vols. I, II, III, and IV, but they too directly transliterate into English.
			</p>

			<h3>Falmer Language</h3>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				The Falmer language appears to be heavily based on the Ayleid language. A large number of words are shared by both languages and it appears that the Falmer language also uses the same grammatical structure. Details on the Ayleid grammatical structure can be found here. One difference is the complete lack of punctuation and capitalization, making separating sentences and clauses very difficult. Punctuation has been inferred from the Dwemer version of the text.
