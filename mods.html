      <h3>What are mods?</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Video game modding (short for "modification") is the process of alteration by players or fans of one or more aspects of a video game such as how it looks or behaves, and is a sub-discipline of general modding. Mods may range from small changes and tweaks to complete overhauls, and can extend the replay value and interest of the game.
        Modding a game can also be understood as the act of seeking and installing mods to the player's game, but the act of tweaking pre-existing settings and preferences is not truly modding.
        Mods have arguably become an increasingly important factor in the commercial success of some games, as they add a depth to the original work, and can be both useful to players and a means of self-expression.
        People can become fans of specific mods, in addition to fans of the game they are for, such as requesting features and alterations for these mods. In cases where mods are very popular, players might have to clarify that they are referring to the unmodified game when talking about playing a game. The term vanilla is often used to make this distinction. "Vanilla Minecraft", for example, refers to the original, unmodified game.
        As early as the 1980s, video game mods have also been used for the sole purpose of creating art, as opposed to an actual game. This can include recording in-game actions as a film, as well as attempting to reproduce real-life areas inside a game with no regard for game play value. This has led to the rise of artistic video game modification, as well as machinima and the demoscene.
        Popular games can have tens of thousands of mods created for them. Popular websites dedicated to modding include Nexus Mods, Mod DB, and Steam Workshop.

      <h3>Nexus Mods</h3>
      <hr/>

        Nexus Mods is a site which allows users to upload and download "mods" (modifications) for computer games. It acts as a source for the distribution of original content. It is one of the largest gaming modification websites on the web, and, as of February 2021, had twenty-five million registered members. Founded in 2001 as a fan site, Nexus Mods was modified into the website TESSsource in 2007. The Nexus Mods network supported 1445 games as of October 2021, with a single forum and a wiki for site and mod-related topics. Recently, the Nexus Mods site expanded to serve as a host for mod files for any modifiable PC game. The website's hosting and publication of various mods has been covered in the gaming and computer press.Nexus Mods was founded by Robin Scott and a friend in August 2001 as a fan site for the Bethesda Softworks game The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind under the name of Morrowind Chronicles. After the success of Morrowind Chronicles, Scott and the friend he was working alongside founded a company by the name of GamingSource and created the website TESSource, which allowed users to upload their modifications and content for games in The Elder Scrolls video game series. Scott soon became tired with the revenue of the websites being split when he was operating the websites by himself, and made the decision to break away from TESSource in 2007 and founded his own website under the name of TESNexus. Scott made use of the TESSource website with his new venture. This resulted in more than 200 additional games being supported by early 2017. Scott indicated in 2013 that the Nexus sites would remain free of corporate investment in the foreseeable future, also avoiding direct ads. Revenue instead came from premium memberships, with the site otherwise free. In December 2015, the website reported a possible security breach of account names, and recommended that its members change their passwords. Financial information was not breached, as the website uses PayPal for all transactions. In 2016, following an extensive survey of existing users, the website received its biggest redesign to date. The redesign saw the introduction of a responsive viewport allowing seamless browsing on a mobile device, an intuitive navigation bar and the ability to pin games to your profile. As of April 2021, Nexus Mods has a reported 26 Million Members. As of 2021, Nexus Mods is the largest gaming modification site on the internet, ranking at #1090 in the Alexa Rankings, with over 4.5 billion downloads since its initial launch. Mods hosted on the site can change games in a number of ways, from adding a first-person perspective to adding fully developed worldspaces with voice-acted quests. Mods for The Witcher have been built for improving immersion, and Nexus Mods is highly noted for its support of the game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and is often regarded as the largest website supporting modifications for games in The Elder Scrolls series of games, with sites like PC Gamer and Kotaku referencing Nexus in multiple articles regarding modifications for The Elder Scrolls series. The website's hosting and publication of various mods has been covered in the gaming and computer press. In 2016, Forbes praised the "Alternate Start - Live Another Life" mod posted to Nexus for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition in a feature article. In January 2017, a Fallout 4 mod on Nexus Mods was covered in the Daily Express, with other Fallout 4 mods reported on by WWG, Paste Magazine, the Christian Times, and PC Gamer.

      <h3>Loverslab</h3>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Skyrim is noted to have an active adult modding scene centered around the website LoversLab, a 1.5 million member "massive sex mod community". Its owner, Ashal, created a mod template for the game known as SexLabs that enabled the creation of adult-themed mods by providing a "foundation of thousands of animations and basic game functions". While largely within the bounds of typical erotica, the mods also include numerous kinks, such as BDSM, with some containing a meaningful story. Many of these modders remain anonymous, as "expressing sexuality in public or in the media beyond holding hands and kisses" remains largely taboo. The site's loose policies also allow controversial and disturbing content, although mods containing pedophilia are strictly banned.

      <h3>Notable mods</h3>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
        <li>The Beyond Skyrim Project</li>
          <p>
            Beyond Skyrim is a massive multi-team mod project that opens the borders and brings Skyrimâ€™s neighboring provinces to life. No longer will you be turned back at the borders of Skyrim, but you can travel onwards to the lands beyond. It is a community consisting of independent teams that came together to set up a common frame for working on their projects. The ultimate goal is to release all provinces of Tamriel, and a few special regions on Nirn, as they would be encountered by the player during the events of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.
          </p>
        <li>The Skyblivion Project</li>
         <p>
           Skyblivion is a volunteer-based project by the TESRenewal modding group. We aim to bring The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion to a new generation of gamers and re-introduce it to long time fans of the series. We are currently in the process of porting and rebuilding Cyrodiil along with all of its quests, locations and characters into Skyrim and Skyrim: Special Edition. Upon release, our mod will be completely modular which means that the player will be able to choose what components he/she wants to have installed. This includes all enhancements developed by the team such as our Landscaping Overhaul, Interior Overhaul, City Overhaul, Weapon/Armor Overhaul and much more. Skyblivion will be 100% free, but in order to play, we require our users to own both Skyrim and Oblivion including the DLCs. Without these requirements our installer will not install the mod.
         </p>
        <li>The SkyWind Project</li>
         <p>
           Skywind is a total recreation of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, built from the ground up in the more modern Skyrim: Special Edition engine. Skywind sheds the shackles of the older game, bringing modern graphics, assets, and sounds, a full cast of voice actors, and all the benefits of fifteen years of gaming improvements, while preserving the incredible characters, locations, and quests with which Morrowind charmed the world all those years ago.
