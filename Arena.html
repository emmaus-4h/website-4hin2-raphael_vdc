					The Elder Scrolls: Arena is an open-world action role-playing video game developed and published by Bethesda Softworks. The
					first game in the Elder Scrolls series, it was released for MS-DOS on March 25, 1994. Like its sequels, Arena takes
					place on the continent of Tamriel, complete with wilderness, dungeons, and a spell creation system that allows players
					to mix various spell effects. In 2004, a downloadable version of the game was made available free of charge as part
					of the tenth anniversary of the series.

				<h3>Plot</h3>
        <hr/>
				<p>
					The game's setting begins in Tamriel on the 389th year of the Third Era, when Emperor Uriel Septim VII summons his advisor
					and Imperial Battlemage Jagar Tharn over concerns of betrayal from within the court. It transpires that his concerns
					were justified when Tharn is revealed to be the traitor, magically trapping the Emperor and his general, Talin Warhaft,
					in another dimension. When Tharn proceeds to magically disguise himself as Emperor in order to usurp the throne, his
					conspiracy is witnessed by mage apprentice Ria Silmane, whom he murders before she can warn the Elder Council. Tharn
					then summons demon minions to replace the Emperor's Guard and in his disguise he sends the player character, a court
					official and subordinate of General Warhaft, to die in the Imperial dungeons. Following her death, Ria uses her magic
					to take an incorporeal form, holding herself together long enough to inform the imprisoned player of Tharn's betrayal
					and instructs them throughout their escape from the infamous dungeons. Past that point, she lacks the power to manifest
					physically and appears to the player during dreams. She creates a key to allow the player to escape the dungeons and
					teleports them to a different province through a mystical Shift Gate. The player is informed that the only way to stop
					Tharn is to get hold of the Staff of Chaos which holds his lifeforce. This staff has been split by Tharn into many fragments
					throughout the continent of Tamriel. Each time one is found, Ria appears to the player the next time they rest, in order
					to provide the general location of the next fragment. At the end of the quest in 3E 399 (a decade after the start of
					the game), the player finds the final piece and reassembles the staff. This, however, does not release the Emperor as
					all of the staff's power has been drained into the Jewel of Fire, an oversight by Ria. The player travels to the Imperial
					City to confront Tharn's minions, the player finds the Jewel of Fire and touches it with the Staff of Chaos, this destroys
					both the jewel and the staff as well as releasing the Emperor. The jewel also turned out to be where Tharn has stored
					his lifeforce and the destruction of the jewel resulted in his death. As a token of respect and gratitude, Uriel Septim
					grants the player the title of Eternal Champion, and Ria Silmane finally enters the afterlife.

				<h3>Introduction to the Main Quest</h3>
        <hr/>
				<p>
					Talin awoke in the darkened cell, his head pounding from the blow it had received. A single candle guttered and flamed in
					one corner. Occasionally the clink of chains could be heard as they swung in a slight, fetid breeze. He knew where he
					was now. It came back to him even as he struggled to his feet. Fighting off the nausea he made his way to a crude stone
					bench. I have been taken by the Emperor, but for what? His thoughts were interrupted by a low moan that came drifting
					down the corridor outside his cell door. Suddenly he was glad for the obvious strength of his cell door. I have been
					left to die, he thought incredulously. They did not even bother to strip me of my possessions. Indeed, upon self-examination
					Talin found that he still carried his dagger and his pouch of money. It seemed that the Emperor had no fears of his
					escape. And why should he? He did a quick circumspection of the room, finding that except for the slime covered walls
					and floor, no water or food had been left. A slow death indeed. Suddenly the air near the center of the cell seemed
					to brighten, slowly coalescing into a globe of brilliance. Talin fell back, shielding his eyes from the glare. The light
					receded, and in the purple afterimages of that burst he could see the shimmering form of a woman floating, her body
					draped in gossamer and blown by an unseen wind.
