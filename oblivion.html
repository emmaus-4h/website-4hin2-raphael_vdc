				<h3>Introduction to the Game</h3>
        <hr/>
				<p>
					The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is a single-player role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published
					by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fourth installment of The Elder Scrolls series and is set in the province of Cyrodiil,
					the heart of the Septim Empire, during the Oblivion Crisis.
				</p>

				<h3>Personal Experience</h3>
        <hr/>
				<p>
					From personal experience, Oblivion was a great game. Though old(2006) it was still relevant and with some graphic overhaul
					mods it looks like it came out at the same time with skyrim. I liked the game, played around 50 hours of it and completed
					the main questline together with the majority of major side-quests. Alltogether a nice game with a good plot, very fitting
					for the Elder Scrolls franchise.
				</p>

				<h3>Plot</h3>
        <hr/>
				<p>
					Oblivion is set during the Third Era, six years after the events of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, although it is not
					a direct sequel to it or any other game.[19] The game is set in Cyrodiil—a province of Tamriel, the continent on which
					all the games in the series have so far taken place. The story begins with the player imprisoned in a cell for an unknown
					crime. Emperor Uriel Septim VII, accompanied by Imperial bodyguards known as the Blades, arrives in the prison, fleeing
					from assassins who have murdered the emperor's three sons and are now targeting him. The emperor and the Blades reveal
					that the player's jail cell contains a secret entrance to a part of the city's sewer that functions as an escape route.
					Pardoned by the emperor, the player follows the group into the sewer, where they come under attack by assassins. The
					blade captain is cut down during the fighting that ensues. Knowing he is destined to die by the hands of the assassins,
					Uriel Septim entrusts the player with the Amulet of Kings, worn by the Septim emperors of Tamriel, and orders the player
					to take it to a man named Jauffre, the grandmaster of the Blades, at Weynon Priory. Immediately afterward, one of the
					assassins kills the emperor. The player escapes the sewer and heads out into the open world of Cyrodiil. The lack of
					an heir for Uriel Septim has broken an old covenant—the barrier to Oblivion: a dangerous realm that is in another dimension.
					Multiple gates to Oblivion open, and an invasion of Tamriel begins by magical creatures known as Daedra, killing and
					destroying anything in their path. Jauffre tells the player that the only way to close the gates permanently is to find
					someone of the royal bloodline to retake the throne and relight the Dragonfires—with the Amulet of Kings—in the Imperial
					City. However, there is an illegitimate son named Martin, who is a priest in the city of Kvatch. Upon arriving at Kvatch,
					the player finds that the Daedra have destroyed the city and very few survivors remain. A massive Oblivion Gate is obstructing
					the main city entrance, and the player must venture through the gate into the Deadlands—one of the planes of Oblivion—in
					order to close it from the inside and allow access to the city. After closing the gate, the player enters Kvatch and
					takes it back from the Daedra with the assistance of surviving guardsmen. Martin has survived, and the player persuades
					him to come to Weynon Priory. The player, now recognized as the Hero of Kvatch, returns to Weynon Priory with Martin,
					finding that it has come under attack by assassins and that the Amulet of Kings has been stolen. The player escorts
					Jauffre and Martin to Cloud Ruler Temple, the stronghold of the Blades. There, Martin is recognized as the emperor and
					is given command of the Blades. The player is optionally entered into their ranks and sets off in search of the amulet.
					After gathering information, the player learns that the group responsible for Uriel Septim's assassination and the theft
					of the amulet are the Mythic Dawn, a cult dedicated to the worshiping of Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Prince of Destruction.
					The cult believes Dagon is the true creator of the world and wish for him to "cleanse" it of all impurities. Killing
					the emperor and thus removing the barriers to Oblivion was the first step in realizing this idea. The player attempts
					to infiltrate the secret meeting place of the cult in the hopes of retrieving the amulet. When the player does so, the
					cult's leader, Mankar Camoran, escapes through a portal, taking the amulet with him. The player takes the book that
					had opened the portal to Martin, who deduces a way to reopen the portal. The player seeks out three key artifacts necessary
					to recreate the portal: a Daedric artifact, The Blood of the Divines (in this case, the armor of the first Septim emperor
					serves as a substitute), and a Great Welkynd Stone. With all three retrieved, Martin reveals that a final ingredient
					is needed: a Great Sigil Stone from inside a Great Gate similar to the one that devastated Kvatch. Martin and Jauffre
					decide to allow the city of Bruma to be attacked by Daedra so that a Great Gate will be opened. Once it is, the player
					obtains the Stone and closes the Gate, also saving Bruma. A portal is created at Cloud Ruler Temple, and the player
					is sent through to Mankar Camoran's created realm of Paradise. After bypassing Daedra, Mythic Dawn members and obstacles,
					the player confronts Camoran and kills him. The player returns the Amulet of Kings to Martin, and they subsequently
					travel to the Imperial City with the Blades to relight the Dragonfires and end the Daedric invasion. They find the city
					under attack by Daedra and an enormous avatar of Mehrunes Dagon himself. The player and Martin fight their way to the
					Temple of the One. There, Martin laments that they are powerless against Dagon's avatar and explains that they can only
					defeat him one way. He bids farewell to the player and shatters the Amulet of Kings, merging himself with the spirit
					of Akatosh, the Dragon-God of Time, thus becoming Akatosh's avatar. After a battle, Akatosh casts Dagon back into Oblivion
					and lets out a mighty roar before turning to stone. Martin, whose soul was consumed by the amulet, enters the afterlife
					to join his forebears. In a telepathic monologue to the player, he sheds an optimistic light, explaining that while
					the Amulet of Kings is destroyed and the throne again lies empty, the gates of Oblivion are now shut forever, and the
					future of Tamriel now lies in the player's hands. The Empire's high chancellor sincerely thanks the player for their
					service during the crisis and proclaims them as the seventh Champion of Cyrodiil.

				<h3>Introduction to the Main Quest</h3>
        <hr/>
				<p>
					The plot begins six years after the events of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind in 3E 433. Emperor Uriel Septim VII is assassinated
					as he attempts to flee from the Imperial City after learning that assassins have killed his sons. However, before his
					death, he hands the Amulet of Kings over to the person who would become the Hero of Kvatch, a lowly prisoner which Uriel
					had seen in his dreams, with instructions to "close shut the jaws of Oblivion." The adventure begins after a prison
					escape and with a quest to find a man named Jauffre - and eventually the illegitimate son of Uriel, the last surviving
					heir to the Septim throne, hidden away for protection since his birth. Ultimately, the Hero must stop the invasion from
					Oblivion and stand between the future of Tamriel and the Daedric Prince of Destruction himself.
