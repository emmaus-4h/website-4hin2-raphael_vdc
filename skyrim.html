				<h3>Introduction to the Game</h3>
        <hr/>
				<p>
					The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a single-player role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by
					Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls action/adventure RPG fantasy video game series,
					and follows The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion by approximately 200 years, during the Fourth Era. The game was announced
					on November 11, 2010 at the Spike Video Game Awards in Los Angeles, with a release date of November 11, 2011. It features
					Radiant A.I., along with Radiant Storytelling or Radiant Story, to help enhance quests, and a new and improved graphics
					engine.
				</p>

				<h3>Personal Experience</h3>
        <hr/>
				<p>
					I have played about 300 hours of skyrim and honestly, it's a very good game especially for it's time and even now it's among
					the best games. Especially the modding community is absolutely amazing. I have played with around 300 mods before which
					is a normal amount of mods for certain people. Majority of those mods were texture overhauls, some other were remakes
					for specific characters like the mod 'Serana Diologue Add-on' which adds thousands of new voicelines to Serana, an essential
					npc in the Dawnguard DLC questline. But overall the game is incredible and if you like RPG's and open world games this
					one is definitely a must.

				<h3>Plot</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>
          Skyrim is set 200 years after the events of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, although it is not a direct sequel. Skyrim is a cold and mountainous region in the north of the continent of Tamriel. It has traditionally been divided into nine administrative sections, called "holds", each governed by a jarl from a larger town. Of these settlements, five - Solitude, Windhelm, Markarth, Riften, and Whiterun - are richer and more powerful. The landscape is littered with forts, camps, and ruins, some of which were built by the now-extinct race of the Dwemer, or Deep Elves.
          While the Nordic race of men are the predominant race in Skyrim, the region forms one province of the much larger Empire, ruled by the Imperials. The Empire has recently fought a war with the Aldmeri Dominion, a powerful confederation of elves, who believe that they are racially superior to the races of men, such as the Imperials and Nords. While the conflict, known as the Great War, ended in a military stalemate, the greatly weakened Empire was forced to sign a humiliating peace treaty called the White-Gold Concordat.
          While most of Tamriel worship a religious pantheon consisting of eight deities, the Nords of Skyrim are accustomed to worship nine, believing that the Nordic general Tiber Septim, the founder of the Empire, ascended to godhood after his death, becoming the deity Talos. The Dominion, led by the intolerant Thalmor sect, rejects this notion, since it implies that a man became greater than any elf, and thus instituted a clause in the Concordat which forbade Talos worship in the Empire. This condition, which was received with great anger in Skyrim, was one of the principal reasons behind the rebellion of Ulfric Stormcloak, the Jarl of Windhelm, against the Empire's Imperial Legion; the game begins with the conflict between the Stormcloaks and Imperials finely poised.
          The race of dragons has long been almost completely extinct - the survival of the last, the sage Paarthurnax, is known only to the Greybeard order of monks. Having ruled over vast swathes of Tamriel in the ancient past, their hegemony was overthrown by the "Dragonborn" warriors, humans who could absorb a dragon's soul and use the powerful draconic spells called "shouts". Three of the most powerful even managed to cast Alduin, the black dragon foretold to consume the world, into the currents of time using an Elder Scroll, a powerful and mystical artifact. The Dragonborn heritage persisted much later than the dragons themselves - Tiber Septim had been one - but the last had died during the events of Oblivion. However, ancient Nordic prophecy maintained that when Alduin at last re-emerged into the world, a "Last Dragonborn" would also appear to fight and defeat him.

				<h3>Introduction to the Main Quest</h3>
        <hr/>
				<p>
					Prior to the beginning of the game, Imperial soldiers catch the Dragonborn illegally crossing the border into Skyrim and
					mistake them for a Stormcloak rebel, a crime for which the player receives a death sentence. The execution of the player
					character by the Imperials in Helgen, a small settlement in Skyrim's south, is interrupted when Alduin starts laying
					waste to the village. The player manages to escape through the tunnels underneath the keep, and heads to the nearby
					village of Riverwood, whose inhabitants ask the player to inform the Jarl of Whiterun, a large town to the north, of
					the dragon attack. After meeting with Jarl Balgruuf, and retrieving a tablet with information about the dragons from
					a nearby barrow on his behalf, the player kills a dragon which attacks nearby and absorbs its soul. After "shouting",
					the player is informed that they must be Dragonborn, and is soon summoned by the Greybeard monks. After a long journey
					and climb up the Throat of the World, the tallest mountain in Tamriel and home of the Greybeards, the Dragonborn is
					informed by Arngeir of their heritage and role in stopping Alduin, and begins their training. The Dragonborn is intercepted
					on one training quest by Delphine, a member of the order of the Blades, who in ancient times had served the Dragonborn.
					Delphine arranges for the Dragonborn to infiltrate the Thalmor Embassy to gain information; they learn that another
					member of the Blades, named Esbern, is in hiding in Riften. When Delphine and the Dragonborn find him, he reveals that
					the ancient Blades had carved a massive engraving in a temple in the Reach, an unstable region in Skyrim's west. This
					carving, called Alduin's Wall, depicted the dragon's defeat at the hands of the ancient Nords, and Esbern deciphers
					that those warriors had used a special shout to remove his ability to fly. The Dragonborn questions Arngeir, who reveals
					that the shout goes against the creeds of the Greybeards. He directs the Dragonborn to Paarthurnax, who lives on the
					summit of the Throat, to better conceal his existence. Paarthurnax reveals that although neither he nor anyone else
					knows the shout, Alduin's defeat through the power of an Elder Scroll had left a gash in time, and theorizes that reading
					a Scroll would allow the Dragonborn to look through time and learn the shout from those who created it. Having delved
					into a massive Dwemer city called Blackreach, far below the ground, the Dragonborn retrieves the Scroll and reads it
					on the Throat, the site of the ancient battle. Alduin arrives and fights with Paarthurnax and the Dragonborn, who has
					learned the shout and overpowers Alduin, who flees. The Dragonborn learns from Esbern how to summon a dragon named Odahviing,
					whom they trap in Whiterun with Jarl Balgruuf's assistance. Odahviing, believing that the Dragonborn is mightier than
					Alduin, turns on his former leader and reveals that he has gone to recover his strength in Sovngarde, the Nordic afterlife,
					where he feeds on the souls of the dead. Since the portal to Sovngarde cannot be reached on foot, Odahviing bargains
					his freedom in exchange for flying the Dragonborn there. Entering Sovngarde, the Dragonborn meets the three heroes who
					had defeated Alduin originally; with their help, the Dragonborn kills Alduin.

				<h3>Expansions (DLC)</h3>
        <hr/>
				<ul>
					<li>Dawnguard</li>
					<p>
						he Elder Scrolls V: Dawnguard is the first official add-on for the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls series, Skyrim.
						Released first for the Xbox 360 on 26 June 2012, and later on 2 August for PC, Dawnguard revolves around an ancient
						prophecy predicted by an Elder Scroll. Foretelling the eternal obfuscation of the sun, the scroll gave instructions
						on how to perform a magic ritual with a mythic bow and a special blood sacrifice. A legion of vampires known as the
						Volkihar Clan, lead by Lord Harkon, seek to actuate the prophecy by performing the ritual; the Dawnguard, a faction
						of crossbow-wielding vampire hunters counters their aims. Skyrim's Dragonborn protagonist chooses whether to join the
						Dawnguard and prevent Nirn from being plunged in irrevocable night, or assist the vampire coven with realizing their
						malevolent ambition.
					</p>
					<li>Hearthfire</li>
					<p>
						The Elder Scrolls V: Hearthfire is the second official add-on for the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls series, Skyrim.
						Released for the Xbox 360 on September 4th, 2012. Hearthfire focuses around purchasing land and designing, building
						and maintaining a homestead. The option to hire stewards, carriage drivers and a personal bard are also available.
						With five pre-built purchasable houses already present in Skyrim, it's now possible to own property in every hold,
						except Winterhold. In addition, an adoption mechanic has been introduced that allows the Dragonborn to adopt children
						and raise them in the newly built home, provided there is room for them. Previously bought homes can be altered to
						have a children's bedroom fitted into them.
					</p>
					<li>Dragonborn</li>
					<p>
						The Elder Scrolls V: Dragonborn is the third and final official add-on for the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls series,
						Skyrim. The plot involves traveling to the island of Solstheim and the return of a mysterious former dragon priest
						called Miraak, one-time ruler of the island. Unlike the ancient dragon priests of Skyrim, Miraak was Dragonborn, supposedly
						the first person to be gifted with the dragon blood, and he possesses the ability to absorb dragon souls, much like
						the Last Dragonborn. The main quest-line also features traveling to Apocrypha, realm of Hermaeus Mora, Daedric Prince
						of forbidden knowledge. Here the Dragonborn must recover the mysterious Black Books in order to learn new powers and
						stop Miraak. In addition, the add-on features a plethora of new quests, characters, dragon shouts, armor, weaponry
						and the ability to tame and ride dragons.
