			<h3>Types of architexture</h3>

			<p>
				Since there is a lot of architecture in all of Tamriel and impossible to name all of them in here I will only take the latest ones, mainly from the fourth and fifth Elder Scrolls games(Skyrim and Oblivion).

				Nords are known as masters of wood and timber construction. Besides the cities of Skyrim, their architectural style is reflected in Bruma, situated in northern Cyrodiil. Nord buildings are built partly underground to conserve heat, and are made with stones, with wood used only for support, and roofs of straw above the wood. These houses are essential to keep in heat in the freezing climate. Similar designs are also seen in Solstheim. Nordic buildings are known for being able to withstand the harshest elements for thousands of years. Old Fort, one of the royal bastions constructed by the First Empire to guard its southern frontier, is a fine example: "towering walls of huge, irregular porphyry blocks fit together without seam or mortar" have stood since the First Era.

				</h3>
				Ayleid cities were built partly above and partly below the surface of the land. Ayleid architecture appears to be a whitish rock, similar to Snow Elf architecture. Ayleid architecture was also integrated with magical artifacts as well, including Great Welkynd Stones, which were large variations of Welkynd Stones, which were used to power cities and increase the power of the people's enchantments. Many statues were built by the Ayleids in their cities to honor the Gods they worshiped. This included statues dedicated to the Aedric Gods Magnus and Auri-El.

				</h3>
				Daedric ruins are great edifices which have a characteristic architecture all of their own. To the Dunmer, this style is called Responsible Architecture, and its architectural style was taught to them by the Daedric Prince Boethiah sometime in the First Era. Daedric Ruins can be found as far as the west in Auridon, where prior to the exodus of the followers of the Prophet Veloth, they built several shrines to the Daedric Princes before they left Summerset for Morrowind. It was believed that after they left, all of these heretical shrines were found and destroyed, but in reality a few remained. The largest concentration of Daedric Ruins can be found in Morrowind. They can also be found in the areas of Black Marsh and Skyrim that border Morrowind. Most of them are shrines to the "Bad Daedra", and many have fallen into ruins. Daedra may be found wandering freely around their grounds both outside and inside, although many may be occupied by outlaws. Shrines typically have a statue dedicated to a Daedric Prince, with offerings presented to them. Stealing these offerings may cause a daedra to be summoned to attack you. Shrines dedicated to the Daedra Lord, Mephala have been commonly referred to as Mephala's Nests. Some of these have been remarkably well preserved.
